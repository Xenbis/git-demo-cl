Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir", not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold, have a seat
In the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder (thunder)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder (thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder
